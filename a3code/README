The following classes have been removed from this code directory---
you will need to implement these yourself to complete Assignment 3:
light.h
texture.h
animation.h

Also included is an incomplete mesh.h class, which is the solution to 
Assignment 1, but requires several extensions to complete Assignment 3.

The included *Viewer and *Generator programs are provided for completeness
and enlightenment.  They work as is.
