Each mesh must be used with its corresponding weight attachment matrix.
(Meshes are in the 'mesh' directory and weight attachment matrices are in 
the 'attach' directory.)

There are two types of mesh, small and large.  Each type has three versions.

Version 0: 
This version gives the best looking results, but it is not fully aligned.  
In particular, the vertices (v) and normals (vn) are aligned one-to-one in 
the face definitions, but the texture vertices (vt) are indexed separately.  
Unfortunately, because it is not fully aligned, your programs might not run 
properly on these files (if you built in a dependence on perfect alignment).

Version 1: 
This version gives the next best looking results, and is fully aligned.  
In particular, the vertex (v), normal (vn) and texture (vt) indexes are all 
aligned one-to-one in the face definitions.  Unfortunately, to achieve perfect 
alignment some small anomalies are introduced around the seams of the texture.
This is very hard to avoid, as it turns out.

Version 2: 
This version is also fully aligned between the vertices (v), normals (vn) and 
textures (vt), and also handles the textures perfectly with no anomalies.  
Instead, there are small anomalies introduced in the mesh, which has small 
splits around the texture seams.

It turns out that it is very difficult to avoid these issues, but hopefully
you will be able to run your programs on at least some of these versions.
(I am just supplying all three to give the greatest chance that you will
find some version that your code runs on and gives nice looking results.)
